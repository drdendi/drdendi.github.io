          <h3>What does leasing a horse mean?</h3>
          <p>When you are leasing a horse, you are paying a set fee
                for the ability and privilege of additional riding time on
                that particular horse. In many ways, leasing a horse is
                similar to owning a horse, with fewer financial
                responsibilities. For many equestrians and horse
                Lovers, leasing a horse is a great step towards
                eventual horse ownership and learning everything that
              goes into caring for horses. </p>

          <p>Half lease: $450.00 per month </p>

          <p>Full lease: $750.00 per month </p>
